# 🛒 Superstore Sales EDA (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **US Superstore dataset** to uncover business insights around sales, profit, customer behavior, discounts, and shipping.  

The goal is to demonstrate how data can be analyzed and visualized in Python to support **business decision-making** in retail.

## 🎯 Business Objectives
The analysis focuses on solving key business questions:

1. **Sales & Profit by Region/State** – Which regions drive revenue, and where are losses happening?  
2. **Category & Sub-Category Performance** – Which product categories are profitable, and which need attention?  
3. **Customer Segment Analysis** – How do Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office segments contribute to revenue?  
4. **Impact of Discounts** – Are high discounts hurting profit margins?  
5. **Shipping Mode Analysis** – Which shipping methods are cost-effective?  
6. **Time Series Trends** – How do sales and profits vary over time?  
7. **Geographical Insights** – Which states or regions consistently show negative profits?

## 📊 Key Insights
- Some states generate **high sales but low profit** due to heavy discounting.  
- **Technology category** performs best in terms of sales; **Furniture** has weak profitability.  
- **Consumers segment** is the largest contributor to revenue.  
- **High discounts** have a strong negative correlation with profits.  
- **First Class & Same Day shipping** are costly and often reduce margins.  
- Sales show **seasonal peaks** during year-end months.
